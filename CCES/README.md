# Analysis of Cooperative Election Study Data (CCES20)

The script included provides some routines to generate graphical summaries 
the explore the patterns of voters in the 2020 presidential election based
on their survey response to religious preferences.

To use the script, you would first need to download the data file:
https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910/DVN/E9N6PH
Download the CSV file "CCES20_Common_OUTPUT.csv".

You will need to update the script to match the folder containing the dataset
before you run the script. It will then generate a PDF file containing a
four-paneled image for each of a variety of religious preferences included
in the survey results.

"Age" in the results are grouped by birth year rather than actual age at the
time of the election.
